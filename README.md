# Campus Connect | Team Project Repository

The final implementation of this project uses Flask (Python) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, communicating via REST API endpoints.
During initial development, React was explored but later removed and is not part of the final codebase.
Please ignore any React-related files or references and consider only the current implemented tech stack for review.

## Project Information
* **Team Name:** Samrat Chandragupta Maurya
* **Project Title:**  Mini College Social Networking (College Connect)

## Project Description
CampusConnect is a college-exclusive social networking web application developed to foster secure and meaningful interactions among students within a single campus ecosystem. The platform provides a centralized digital space where verified college members can create profiles, share content, build connections, and engage in private conversations in a controlled and privacy-focused environment.

Unlike public social media platforms, CampusConnect enforces restricted access through institutional verification (college email domain or student ID authentication), ensuring that only authorized students can join the network. Users can publish posts containing text, images, or videos, explore a real-time college-wide feed, and interact through likes and comments.

The application features a structured connection system that allows students to send, receive, and manage connection requests. Private one-to-one messaging is enabled strictly after mutual connection approval, ensuring user privacy and preventing unsolicited communication. Chat history is securely stored and accessible for future reference.

CampusConnect is designed with a clean, intuitive interface and scalable architecture, making it suitable for academic institutions seeking a lightweight social networking solution. The platform emphasizes usability, security, and performance while promoting collaboration, community engagement, and digital socialization within college campuses.

🎯 Objectives

The objective of CampusConnect is to provide a secure, college-exclusive social networking platform that enables students to connect, communicate, and collaborate within their campus community. The system aims to ensure authenticated access for verified college members, promote meaningful peer interactions through posts and connections, and maintain user privacy by allowing private messaging only between mutually connected users. By offering a simple, engaging, and intuitive interface, CampusConnect seeks to enhance campus social life and digital connectivity.
