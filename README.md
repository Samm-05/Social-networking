# Social-networking | Team Project Repository

The final implementation of this project uses Flask (Python) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for the frontend, communicating via REST API endpoints.
During initial development, React was explored but later removed and is not part of the final codebase.
Please ignore any React-related files or references and consider only the current implemented tech stack for review.

## Project Description
The Interactive Machine Learning Algorithm Simulator is an educational web-based platform designed to help students and beginners understand how machine learning algorithms work visually and intuitively.
Instead of learning ML concepts only through formulas and theory, users can interact with algorithms, adjust parameters in real time, and observe how results change instantly through charts, graphs, and animations.The project focuses on learning clarity, conceptual understanding, and hands-on experimentation rather than high-performance model training.

🎯 Objectives



## Technical Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), and Chart.js for real-time mathematical visualizations and animations.
Databse: This project does not include a database since there is no user-side data storage or persistence required. All operations are handled in real time.
Backend: Flask (Python), utilizing NumPy for manual implementation of machine learning algorithms (Gradient Descent, K-Means clustering logic, etc.).
Tools/APIs: Fetch API for frontend-backend communication and Python Virtual Environments for dependency management.
